Goals:
- Tetris
  - Implement simple game
  - Establish platform + engine + game relation
- Simple level editor
  - Tilemap based environment
  - Place out game objects in environment
  - "Mario maker" style

## TODO
- Run current scene in engine
- Save scene to disk

- Add bar with run button (window that can't be docked)
- Add property editor for selected node
- Fix ImWin32 to render in order of item push _not_ in alphabetical order
- Add context menu to log window with "clear" option
- Capture `platform::run_command` stdout and stderr to in-memory log and print in editor log window
- Try to fix slightly blurry ImGui font by building font atlas ourselves
- Add hot reload option to menu bar
- Set up cpu profiling
- Enable caching for GitHub Actions
- Figure out how to make alt-key focus the main menu
- Fix the window resize behavior (should only resize while left button held)
- Split render and update into separate threads
- (Mess around with Bayer matrix dithering and Perlin noise)

## Doing

## Done
- Add TextSystem to store TextNode instances
- Return a key-value pair for VecMap::iterator
- Fix canvas moving outside of ImGui::Image we render the canvas inside of
- Make `engine::State` heap allocated to get around constructors not being linked
- Create "Hello World" text scene using a Text component and scene tree
- Remove `glGetUniformLocation` calls from hot loop, cache locations after shader loaded.
- Add a RingBuffer type
- Change theming to be less ImGui and a little more native Win32 looking
- Factor out editor_ui code into component-functions (menu bar, windows)
- Add logging window to editor
- Add unit tests for Rect (since we have helper methods now)
- Move Rect to `core` namespace
- Rename top level files to match namespace
- Move editor to its own namespace (editor, engine, platform, core)
- Zoom in and out of canvas
- Render canvas
- Setup ImGui docking branch
- Replace ImGui main menu bar with a native Win32 one
- Organize platform files into directories
- Add config file support, use to store window mode, size and position
- Add --windowed command line argument to start game windowed
- Change window title to be `<Project name> - Engine 2024` with a `*` after `<Project name>` if unsaved changes
- Replace all `const T*` with `const T&` so that we can easily tell when using an out-parameter by `f(&val)`
- Move all state headers into "engine/state" directory
- Rename "project.h" to "project_state.h"
- Add infrastructure for running engine as standalone game
- Add "Run", "Restart" and "Continue" buttons to editor for jumping in/out of game
- Add keyboard ctrl+s and ctrl+o shortcuts for save and load
- Save as option
- Warn before discarding unsaved changes
- Track if project has unsaved changes
- Move signal.h to core
- Move tagged_variant.h to "core"
- Move util.h header into a "core" namespace (i.e. project standard library)
- Add interface for writing and reading zip files
- Rename engine.cpp to engine_api.cpp
- Add projects, load / save game data
- Use std::variant for PlatformAPI commands
- Switch between editor mode / game mode
- Give feedback in window title if compilation failed
- Fix so that engine unit tests links against DLL statically
- Render level editor canvas (Aseprite style grey checker board)
- Fix debugging of engine DLL (Probably needs to copy PDB when copying DLL)
- Tidy up window animation
- Hot reload engine library with F5
- Rename `add_font` to `add_ttf_font`
- Rename `deinitialize` to `shutdown`
- Let ImGui steal keyboard input
- Pick resolution while running
- Let ImGui steal mouse input
- Render fonts
- Resolution aware mouse input
- Add ImGui
- Full screen support (F11)
- Fixed resolution (integer scaling to fit window)
- Resizable window
- Add alpha blending to renderer
- Render API commands (draw line, shapes etc. as data that doesn't depend on OpenGL)
- Render using pixel coordinates instead of normalized coordinates
- Render textures
- Keyboard input
- Add Google Test
- Update CMakeLists to set VS startup project
- Process input into a struct that's passed to engine::update
- Add render function to engine
- Move init stuff into platform
- Add ASSERT macro that logs error, debug breaks, then exits
- Only use warnings as errors in CI build, not local
- Render APIs
- Add logging
- Add DLL based hot reloading
- Add OpenGL
- Add build github action
- Create SDL2 window
- Add clang format
